## Map Dashboard
*	Citi Bike is mainly used in the Manhattan area, specifically Midtown. This is easy to see, as Citi Bike is mainly used for commuting as Trip Activities Dashboard show and a lot of buildings are located in Midtown according to NYC buildings map:  https://tbaldw.in/nyc-buildings/
*	Pershing Square North Station is the most popular start and end station. Most popular trip start stations are also popular end stations.

## Next Step:
Use data from a few different date points to ask questions such as:
*	Which month of the year is busiest?
*	How has the usage of Citi Bike changed compared to 1, 3 or 5 years ago?
